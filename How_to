Install Matlab from mathworks.com
Store the PRISM.m code in the file you wish to work from.
Run PRISM.m in Matlab. It may ask you to change the folder, this is Matlab just trying to find the right directory to access files.
In the 'workspace' tab click the dropdown arrow then click 'new'. Double click the new selection and paste in your data with the columns: q, I(q), Error I(q).
  This should save it as a 'double' type, which is what we need. If you find it is stored as a 'table', this will not be read properly by the code.
Alternatively, you can copy your data then click the dropdown button in the workspace and click 'paste'. This will bring up a new box, and you will need to 
make sure it saves as a 'numerical matrix'. Then once you're done, click 'Import' and it should show up in the workspace.

Before you run your code, make sure you save the file you just created into the same directory as the PRISM.m code otherwise it won't be able to be read.

Type in the imported file name into the filename line of code within the quotation marks. filename = 'yourfilename_here'
Copy this name and paste it in the data code line so that it reads 
data = yourfilename_here;

Run the code to ensure a figure appears with your data and the default model.
To fit Manually (suggested to begin with):
- Set LM_fit = 0.
- Adjust the UI Parameters to obtain an initial guess.

To fit with Levenbergâ€“Marquardt:
- set LM_fit = 1.
- Fit!

The output q, I(q) values from the PRISM fit are stored in a matrix called 'PRISMfit'.
The parameters for the fit can be found in a matrix called 'PRISM_parameters'.
