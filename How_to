Import data into MATLAB as a .mat file with your data in the form: q, I(q), Error I(q). Ensure that the file type is set to numeric matrix.
If the data is imported as a table, it will not be read properly by the code. In the Workspace, your file should be a size x size DOUBLE.

Type in the imported file name into the filename line of code within the quotation marks. filename = 'your_filename'
Copy this name and paste it in the data code line so that it reads 
data = your_filename;

Run the code to ensure a figure appears with your data and the default model.
Adjust the UI Parameters towards the top of the code to manually fit your data.

Currently there is no implementation of Levenberg-Marquardt or any fitting routines.
